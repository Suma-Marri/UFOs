# UFOs

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, to add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Summary
The search elements are case-sensitive and it would be nice if we allowed users to input the data uppercase. Also, the date functioanlity is not very user friendly. For example, the user can input 1/08/2010, and not get any results because the website doesn't recognize that that date is equal to 1/8/2010. I would fix the date option or seperate the the date feild in to 3 feilds: month, day, and year.
